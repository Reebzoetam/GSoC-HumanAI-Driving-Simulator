The previous plots displayed in [/old_plots](/results/plots/old_plots) below were generated by my older version of code. 

Some improvements/changes were made to my new plots in [/plots](/results/plots):
- Chunking may have changed the data (number of words associated with each timestamp, sentiment based on groups of words, etc.) that was used to graph these plots
- The gradients now feature the intensity of the sentiment rather than the confidence level for a more fine-grained nuanced analysis of sentiment
